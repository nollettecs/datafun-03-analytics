1. I created a repository in Github with title
2. I cloned down my project to VS Code, using VS Code clone function (tried to go a different route didnt work)
3. Worked on heart of the project throughout VS Code, edit, add, commit
4. Steps through functions go (fetch, write, and then process)
5. Attempted to push to Github (still a work in progress)
